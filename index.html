        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src= "images/Marcela.jpg" height="300"/>
        <p>My name is Marcela, I'm 31, and I'm studying to become an elementary school teacher but have always had a strong interest in art and computers. I've taken several graphic design and art classes at City College and recently became aware of Mesa College's web design program. Although I find web development interesting and have always wanted to create my own webpage, I've always found coding a bit intimidating. I'm currently enrolled in various web development and graphic design classes at San Diego City College and Cuyamaca College.</p>

        <h2>Reason for Taking This Course</h2>
        <img src= "images/Code.jpg" height="300"/>
        <img src= "images/GD.jpg" height="300"/>
        <p>I currently work as a classroom aide for the LMSVSD. I also have trouble picking something to stick to, which is why I've ended up taking courses in many unrelated subjects (library science, graphic design, fine arts, teachers education) and changed my major numerous times. I used to see it as a weakness, but I've come to make peace with it and use it to my advantage. I've used Google Sites to make a website for a class and am trying to learn how to use WordPress , but that is the extent of my experience in web development. Iâ€™ve taken several graphic design classes and have experience making logos, flyers, magazine covers, restaurant menus, and album covers. My reason for taking this course is because I want to learn how to build my own website from scratch and also to complete courses for Mesa College's Web Development program. </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <img src= "images/hiking.jpg" height="300"/>
        <img src= "images/crochet.jpg" height="300"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Kinitting</li>
            <li>Hiking</li>
            <li>Watching cooking vidoes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've listed my top three hobbies above. I enjoy knitting, sewing, hiking, drawing, going to the movies, watching cooking videos, swimming, and taking college courses. Although work and school don't allow me to spend as much time working on my hobbies as I'd like, I try to squeeze in time whenever I can. I am an amateur when it comes to crochet but would like to learn more complex patterns. I recently came upon an interesting article where the author explains how crocheting taught her coding basics. I think I will pull out my crocheting hooks while I do the readings for this class!</p>
